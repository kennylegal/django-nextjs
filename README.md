# Django x Next.js Boilerplate

This is a boilerplate for a Django x Next.js project. It includes a Django backend and a Next.js frontend.


This boilerplate contains two projects in one repo:
- `backend`: A Django project using Django Ninja for the API and JWT Auth
- `frontend`: A Next.js project using Shadcn UI and HTTP-only cookies for JWT Auth

For long term maintenance, it is recommended to split these projects into dedicated repos. They exist together in this repo for convenience.


## Backend: Django x Django Ninja

Includes:
- Django Ninja API
- JWT Auth through django-ninja-jwt
- Env variable loading through python-decouple


## Frontend: Next.js

Includes:
- Next.js
- Tailwind CSS
- TypeScript
- Shadcn UI
- HTTP-only cookies for JWT Auth
- Proxied API calls to backend with automatic Auth tokens
